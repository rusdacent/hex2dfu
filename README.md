hex2dfu
=======

Simple command line tool to convert file format from Intel HEX to STM32 DFU.





Compile
=======

hex2dfu is a single C file application and can be easly compile by any ANSI C compiler. No makefile required. Just type:

gcc hex2dfu.c -o hex2dfu.exe

I`m using mingw32 under Windows, change parameters regards your enviroment.



To enable ED25519 code signing feature, download ED25519 code from https://github.com/encedo/ed25519 or https://github.com/orlp/ed25519 to folder ED25519
and type:

gcc hex2dfu.c ED25519/*.c -o hex2dfu.exe

**Fork UPD** \
Add ED25519 files to repo

Using
=====

1. Simple convertion

   hex2dfu.exe -i infile.hex -o outfile.dfu


2. Convertion with changing VID/PID

   hex2dfu.exe -i infile.hex -o outfile.dfu -p 0x0483 -v 0xdf11


3. As before with extra device version included (otherwise 0xFFFF will be placed)

   hex2dfu.exe -i infile.hex -o outfile.dfu -p 0x0483 -v 0xdf11 -d 0x1234


3. EXTRA: Calculated CRC32 of the file and embed meta data at given address

   hex2dfu.exe -i infile.hex -o outfile.dfu -c 0x08011000


4. Code siging: To sign the code ED25519 'secret' need to be provided

   hex2dfu.exe -i infile.hex -o outfile.dfu -c 0x08011000 -S d4411fa9d5cb6f91b7bd18e4ab41e7d03bf37e1d738c12b923ef0f09de90e6cf
   

5. Like above but extra data (-P) are added:

   hex2dfu.exe -i infile.hex -o outfile.dfu -c 0x08011000 -S d4411fa9d5cb6f91b7bd18e4ab41e7d03bf37e1d738c12b923ef0f09de90e6cf -e -P DEADBEEF
   

6. Like above but additional data are public key based on signing secret:

   hex2dfu.exe -i infile.hex -o outfile.dfu -c 0x08011000 -S d4411fa9d5cb6f91b7bd18e4ab41e7d03bf37e1d738c12b923ef0f09de90e6cf -e
   
   
Automated CRC32 generation in very usefull when custom bootloader is in use. We can check firmware at every MCU boot and execute only when file ingerrity is authenticated. Otherwise performe failover (e.g. start USB bootloader). 

Custom USB Bootloader supporting CRC32 checking during boot will be open sourced soon. Stay tuned :)
